* In-built blog system of some kind?
  Some really very very simple. I'm happy to 
  just edit text files on the server really.
  Webace itself gives you a commenting system.
  So really it's just about the indexing.

  Check a 'blogs' directory for *.phtml files,
  grab the file-system created-at date and 
  show a list. That's basically it.


Things to do later:
* Add auto-post-to-email
* Add auto-post-to-twitter
* Add auto-post-to-facebook
* Add avatar for those with certain nicks??
* Spam filters, inevitably, eventually.
* User-lists: view all stuff by this list of users
* View all stuff by top-rated?
  * Implies some rating stuff
* Clean up "commands" stuff, it needs a proper parser
  most likely, certainly at least each case calling a
  different function.
* Make a version that will allow a website owner
  to embed something so ve, and only ve (or ver
  minions) can reply in one-on-one chats with
  visitors? Probably a paid b2b service I guess?
