/*************************************************************
* Oh, I just realized, my notes.txt file is on Githut these
* days. Welcome!... I keep a file in lots of different
* directories to remind me of stuff. Notes, on a directory.
* The stuff in here is notes on the coding either coming
* up or planned or recently done in the project WebAce.
*
* Patches to this file will be accepted only if they
* meet the stringent and completely unwritten spec
* that lives nowhere other than in my head. But if
* you really do have something that should be written
* here, then do so, I'll either edit it to the right
* arbitrary format or refuse it.

* People are saying they're getting double-messages.
  I guess we can keep an array of all messages ID
  in the jquery part and only actually add things
  if they're not already there.

* Things learned from day one:
  * Blog topic: Percent of first day messages that look like attacks
  * Really a MASSIVE time-suck!
  * Double-messages
  * iPad not doing scrolly divs
  * That dude what said "add line-breaks" was right. 
    * Multi-line posts are needed. Which means shifting
      the interface to a text-area I guess? Which
      I don't like.
      * Maybe shift-return TURNS it into a textarea?
  * "it looks 90s" 
    * That's a weird one, since it's using so many naughties
      CSS things: drop-shadows, web-fonts, animating divs,
      no graphics files.
    * May just be the colour scheme. Perhaps we used up all
      4096 3-digit colours in the 90s?
    * Better .css file would be good though. A competition?
      Need popularity first.
    * Select the .css files from a set? Make it themeable?
      * Adding a twitter-bootstrap one should should most people up.
    ***
      * Well how SHOULD it look? I admit the colour was chosen
        for it's hex representation rather than it's response
        in the eyeball.
        * Pallet from a .jpeg photo?
        * I mean it needs to match EVERY WEBSITE! Is that possible?
          * Black/white? 
            * Monochrome based on current CSS? Is that possible?
    * Mostly just THEMES. Certainly THEMES.


  * I wanted to click URLS to see what had been posted to
    that URL rather than to 'everywhere' as I had the main 
    window set to. 
    * Maybe have 'mode' tracked in client? 
     * If we had client-mode=-0, when would that get changed?
    * Launch URL starts with client-mode=0, but still gets
      changed by /load or /mode etc.
      * TICK!
    * AHAH! It shows only PREVIOUS posts from the
      current page but ALL posts from future pages!
      Yes!
  


* 



Things to do later:
* Fix big images
* Scroll only when at bottom already?
  * Or only when option turned on.
* Private chat.
  * 
* Alert when new messages
  * Audio
  * Visible in top-bar
* Add auto-post-to-email
* Add auto-post-to-twitter
* Add auto-post-to-facebook
* Auto-notification (to email?) with replies
* Add avatar for those with certain nicks??
* Spam filters, inevitably, eventually.
* User-lists: view all stuff by this list of users
* View all stuff by top-rated?
  * Implies some rating stuff
* Clean up "commands" stuff, it needs a proper parser
  most likely, certainly at least each case calling a
  different function.
* Make a version that will allow a website owner
  to embed something so ve, and only ve (or ver
  minions) can reply in one-on-one chats with
  visitors? Probably a paid b2b service I guess?
  * Can already direct WebAce to post to a given URL.
    * Force it to lock into mode 1, and lock to a random non-url URL.
    * Need a way to make the messages private to all but Webmaster and Minions
    * Yeah, comes after, and using, some kinda Private Chat function.
