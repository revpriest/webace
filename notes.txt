Things to do later:
* Private chat.
  * 
* Add auto-post-to-email
* Add auto-post-to-twitter
* Add auto-post-to-facebook
* Add avatar for those with certain nicks??
* Spam filters, inevitably, eventually.
* User-lists: view all stuff by this list of users
* View all stuff by top-rated?
  * Implies some rating stuff
* Clean up "commands" stuff, it needs a proper parser
  most likely, certainly at least each case calling a
  different function.
* Make a version that will allow a website owner
  to embed something so ve, and only ve (or ver
  minions) can reply in one-on-one chats with
  visitors? Probably a paid b2b service I guess?
  * Can already direct WebAce to post to a given URL.
    * Force it to lock into mode 1, and lock to a random non-url URL.
    * Need a way to make the messages private to all but Webmaster and Minions
    * Yeah, comes after, and using, some kinda Private Chat function.
