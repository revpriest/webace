ADD THE LIBRIRIES
====================
$ mkdir library

Symlink Zend into the library dir. Something similar to this: 
ln -s /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/Zend/ library/

Download and unpack HTMLPurifier into the library dir too,
find out how here: http://htmlpurifier.org/


MAKE THE APPLICATION SETTINGS
=============================
$ cp application/configs/applicaiton.ini.template application/configs/applicaiton.ini

Then edit the new application config.ini to point at your database, and
change the salt lines to something long and random.

Now run the DB schema script:

$ php scripts/load.mysql.php

Set up the apache config in the usual Zend way with
the doc-root set to the 'public' directory.


It should all work by taking the domain-name it
needs to post to from your _SERVER variable hopefully,
and so be serving messages from your server right
away. You'll need to edit the email body text though.


News/Blog section
==================

$mkdir application/views/scripts/blogs

Edit files in that directory with filenames like
"20121229-Title.phtml" and write pretty much
arbitrary PHP in 'em. I know *most* people won't
find that the easiest way to add new blog
entries but *I* do.

Good luck! Let me know what you make with it.
