Checkout the git repo, then:
$ cp application/configs/applicaiton.ini.template application/configs/applicaiton.ini

Then edit the new application config.ini to point at your database

Now run the DB schema script:

$ php scripts/load.mysql.php

Set up the apache config in the usual Zend way with
the doc-root set to the public directory here.

You'll probably need to do a search/replace on
the webace.dalliance.net URLs or something. Patches
to stick that in the config gratefully merged.

Good luck! Let me know what you make with it.
