ADD THE LIBRIRIES
====================
$ mkdir library

Symlink Zend into the library dir. Something similar to this: 
ln -s /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/Zend/ library/

Download and unpack HTMLPurifier into the library dir too,
find out how here: http://htmlpurifier.org/


MAKE THE APPLICATION SETTINGS
=============================
$ cp application/configs/applicaiton.ini.template application/configs/applicaiton.ini

Then edit the new application config.ini to point at your database, and
change the salt lines to something long and random.

Now run the DB schema script:

$ php scripts/load.mysql.php

Set up the apache config in the usual Zend way with
the doc-root set to the public directory here.

You'll probably need to do a search/replace on
the webace.dalliance.net URLs or something. Patches
to stick that in the config gratefully merged.

Good luck! Let me know what you make with it.
