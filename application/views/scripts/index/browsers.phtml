<h1>Browser Compatibility</h1>
<p><b>WebAce</b> does some fairly fancy stuff with
cross domain ajax calls from Java-script, and these
things aren't all supported well on all browsers.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Firefox</dt>
     <dd>Should all work!</dd>
  <dt>Chrome</dt>
     <dd>Should all work!</dd>
  <dt>Safari</dt>
     <dd>Should all work!</dd>
  <dt>Internet Explorer</dt>
     <dd>Internet Explorer does not allow cookies to be sent
         over a cross-site ajax request. We do what we can with
         a session ID.<br/>
         This means that in IE you'll have to reset your
         nickname/email/session stuff in general each time
         you launch <b>WebAce</b> from any site other than
         <b>WebAce</b> itself. You can do this quite quickly
         with /save and /load session. Check the <a href="/?page=help">help
         page</a> to learn how.</dd>
  <dt>Opera</dt>
     <dd>Opera bans all cross-domain javascript calls entirely.
         Webace sill still work if launched on a webace page
         itself, but will throw security errors if you launch
         it on other web pages elsewhere.</dd>
         </dd>
  <dt>iPhone / iPad</dt>
     <dd>It seems that the iPad doesn't allow scrolling content
         inside a div of fixed size, so I'm told this doesn't
         work on an iPad. There is <a href="http://cubiq.org/iscroll">some project
         to allow it</a> but not having an iPad it's hard to
         test. If anyone wants to send me an iPad to test with
         I'll happily give it a go :).</dd>
  <dt>Android browsers<dt>
     <dd>I haven't the faintest idea. Give it a try, it won't
         actually break the hardware. Let me know if it works
         at all, or better yet, send me a phone to test with 
         ;)</dd>
